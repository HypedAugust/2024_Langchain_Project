## 🧠 **About This Repository**  
Welcome to my 2024 LangChain project space! This repository is a collection of practice projects where I experiment with LLM (Large Language Models) and create a working environment to hone my skills. These projects also serve as a record of my progress in learning and applying LangChain technology. 🌱

## 📈 **Current Project Status**

Here’s a glimpse of the ongoing projects:

- **📄 PDF-Bot**: A chatbot project that uses the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique to summarize research papers. Perfect for digesting complex information quickly! 💡
  
- **📊 Pandas-Bot**: A single-agent project that reads Excel files and visualizes the data, helping with quick insights and analytics. 📈

- **📑 Analyze-Report-Bot**: A Sequential Agent implementation that processes and analyzes reports step by step. Efficient, thorough, and smart! 🤖

## ⚙️ **Running Locally**
To use these projects on your local machine, be sure to apply your own API keys in the environment variables (`env`). This allows seamless integration and performance of the models.

## 🎯 **Inspiration**
Through these practice projects, I hope not only to improve my own skills but also to provide inspiration and guidance to others interested in LangChain and AI development. Happy coding and learning! 💻✨
